# Here we fit symmetry-constrained atomic MDCM models to the atomic multipoles from
# the previous step. Only one atom of each symmetry-related group is
# fitted. To improve quality we should run more fits to choose the best, and also
# increase the number of DE tries for each fit. Here we show an example with 5 fits
# and 8 refinement attempts (NTRY) per fit. Note that multiple fits are more
# important when running with symmetry-constraints as different constraints are
# selected for each fit.

# Note: adapt the Slurm script below to whatever cluster you're using...
