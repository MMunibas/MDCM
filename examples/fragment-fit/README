Example "Fragment Fit" (Mike Devereux)

This example shows how molecular fitting problems can be broken down with an
intermediate fragment-fitting step. The approach allows an MDCM to be fitted for
large systems with many charges, where a global fit with differential evolution
would be too slow.

Note that symmetry-constrained fitting would be more appropriate for the 
benzene molecule considered here, this example is meant for ilustrative purposes
only.

The procedure is:

1. Fit atomic multipoles to the reference ESP (least-squares)
2. Fit a separate charge model for each atom to the multipolar atomic ESP
(differential evolution, simplex refinement)
3. Combine the atomic charge models to create a starting population for fragment
fitting, and fit fragment charge models to the fragment ESP, as defined by the
fitted multipoles (differential evolution, simplex refinement)
4. Combine the fragment models in such a way as to minimize the total molecular
RMSE of the ESP (based on different permutations of fragment models).
5. Refine the molecular model, for manageable systems using differential 
evloution or for large systems using simplex optimization only. One example of
each approach is given, differential evolution is considerably slower with
typically only a modest improvement for the refinement step.
6. Use the fitted model to generate an ESP grid that can be compared to the
original reference ESP, in order to assess the quality of the fit

An exhaustive procedure is again used to identify the model with the
best compromise between number of charges and RMSE in the ESP, with several
fits performed to increase the chances of finding a near-optimal solution.
