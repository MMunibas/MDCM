Example "Symmetry Constrained" (Mike Devereux)

This example shows how symmetry constraints can be introduced during MDCM
fitting. The procedure is as follows:

1. Fit atomic multipoles to the reference ESP without applying symmetry
constraints (least-squares)
2. Fit a separate charge model for each group of symmetrically equivalent atoms,
i.e. for one atom of each group of atoms that are considered equivalent due to
symmetry (differential evolution, simplex refinement)
3. Combine the atomic charge models to create a starting population for
molecular fitting, and fit a symmetry-constrained molecular charge model by
fitting one charge from each symmetry environment and transforming its position
to the other symmetry-equivalent atoms, and by constraining each charge to
respect the local atomic symmetry environment (differential evolution, simplex
refinement)
4. Use the fitted model to generate an ESP grid that can be compared to the
original reference ESP, in order to assess the quality of the fit

Note that an exhaustive procedure is again used to identify the model with the
best compromise between number of charges and RMSE in the ESP, but this time, in
order to respect molecular symmetry, some combinations are not possible. For
example, in benzene molecular symmetry can be maintainted with 6 or 12 charges,
but there is no way to maintain C6 symmetry using 5 charges.
