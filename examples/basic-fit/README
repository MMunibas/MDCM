Example "Basic Fit" (Mike Devereux)

This example shows the basic fitting procedure using standard MDCM
functionality with no additional options. The procedure is as follows:

1. Fit atomic multipoles to the reference ESP (least-squares)
2. Fit a separate charge model for each atom using the atomic multipoles to
define an atomic ESP (differential evolution, simplex refinement)
3. Combine the atomic charge models to create a starting population for
molecular fitting, and fit a molecular charge model to the reference ESP
(differential evolution, simplex refinement)
4. Use the fitted model to generate an ESP grid that can be compared to the
original reference ESP, in order to assess the quality of the fit
5. Convert the charge model to CHARMM .dcm format for use in running molecular
dynamics simulations

Note that an exhaustive procedure is used to identify the model with the best
compromise between number of charges and RMSE in the ESP. To this end each
atomic and molecular charge fit with a given number of charges is run several
times to provide the model with lowest RMSE. In additional, several separate
fits are run for each number of charges. The result is that a truly "minimal"
model can be selected, that uses as few charges as possible to attain the
desired level of accuracy.
